Newest entry first. Each entry covers: what was done, what's now unblocked, and
what should happen next. Read this at the start of any session to get context
without trawling git history or old chat windows.

## 2026-04-12

**Done:**
- Sprint 9 migrations (20260411020000–20260411100000) applied locally — `jurisdiction_id` now on `civic_initiatives`, plus 5 other schema additions
- `apps/civitics/app/api/initiatives/[id]/advance/route.ts` patched: PGRST116 (no rows) now returns 404; other query errors return 500 with code. Previously all errors silently became 404.
- TASK-13 reviewed — clean. `text-gray-900` added to `LabeledSelect` in `GraphConfigPanel.tsx`
- TASK-14 reviewed — Qwen truncated `InlineEditor.tsx` at line 203 mid-className. Repaired by Claude.
- TASK-15 reviewed — clean. All 8 `.label` → `.name` in `ForceGraph.tsx` correct.
- TASK-16 reviewed — Qwen truncated `useGraphData.ts` at line 261 mid-declaration (`const isPac`). Repaired by Claude.
- DB types regenerated (`packages/db/src/types/database.ts`) after migrations. Note: on Windows PowerShell use `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllLines()` — `>` redirect produces UTF-16.
- FIXES.md and QWEN_PROMPTS.md statuses brought up to date.

**Unblocked:**
- TASK-12 (Civic Initiatives: core API routes) — was BLOCKED on sprint 1 migrations; those are now applied locally. Can queue now.
- "Open for deliberation" button should now work — test on a draft initiative to confirm.

**Up next:**
- Queue next Qwen batch from remaining FIXES.md items and PHASE_GOALS.md gaps
- Remaining BUGS in FIXES.md: all resolved this session — no open bugs
- Next FIXES.md priorities: mobile responsiveness (🟠 M), a11y audit (🟠 M), SEO/OG metadata (🟠 M), skeleton states (🟡 M)
- TASK-12 is unblocked and ready to queue
